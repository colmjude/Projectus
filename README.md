# Projectus

Initial project setup. Includes basic directory structure and a naked style guide, with more to come (see TODO). I use it to help me out at the beginning of projects but feel free to fork, use and change.

## Credit
Reading this article (http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides) by Anna Debenham inspired me to think about putting one of these together.
Seeing and using Paul Robert Lloyd's Barebones project (https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/barebones) encouraged me to finally put it together.

## TODO
* ~~change to work with normalize.css as its base CSS~~
* strip more of the element usage content, that can be added on a per project basis
* add a pattern primer, going to use this node.js port (https://github.com/beardtwizzle/pattern-primer-on-node) of The Pattern Primer (<https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer/>) by Jeremy Keith (<http://adactio.com/>)
